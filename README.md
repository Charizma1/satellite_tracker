This is the code for my [Satellite tracker](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/9py5qd/i_made_a_thingy_that_shows_satellites_and_space/).
It's in an extremely rough state...

The orbit_np.py file is a modified version of [pyorbital](https://github.com/pytroll/pyorbital)
(it calculates the orbits of multiple satellites at the same to increase performance).

Requires https://github.com/PaulKlinger/LIBtft144 and https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x + a bunch of libraries from PyPi.
